# Take Home Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Jibusasa platform has over 30 resources of which are exposed to the clients through REST API.
For each resource, only three endpoints are exposed:

1. Create resource endpoint,
2. Fetch single resource by ID endpoint, 
3. Fetch a list of resources endpoint

In this dummy server, we are only focussed on three resources (Hotels, Menu items, and Orders)

## The setup

To run the project:
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Use `npm run start` to start the server. The server will be accessible on http://0.0.0.0:3000. 

All the code is found in src/main.js and most probably you won't even need to touch the other files. 

This challenge aims to test two things:
1. Ability to write bug free code
2. Understanding and application of coding and api standards

## The Task

Below are the two specific tasks to be performed:

1. Expose API endpoints to a) Create a new Order, b) Fetch a list of all orders c) Fetch a single order by id
2. What improvements, following proper standards, can be made? Feel free to make as many changes as necessary

## Submission

Package the modified code (excluding the node_modules folder) into a zip file and send back to morris@jibusasa.com
